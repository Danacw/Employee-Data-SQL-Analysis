# SQL-Challenge
UC Davis Data Analytics Bootcamp | Unit 9 SQL Challenge | Hewlett Packard Analysis

For this challenge, I used PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy to analyze data on employee salaries, titles, demographics etc. Through this analysis, I concluded that most employees earned a salary greater than $40,000 and less than or equal to $60,000. I also noticed that the average salaries by title were fairly similar, with the lowest average being $48,506.80 for senior engineers, and the highest average being $58,550.17 for senior staff.

**Data Folder:**
- Contains all data used in analysis.

**Images**
- Contains ERD, and historgram and bar graph images. 

**Queries**
- Contains query for creating tables and executing an analysis in PostgreSQL, as well as a Jupyter Notebook file for the bonus analysis.
