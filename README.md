# SQL-Challenge
UC Davis Data Analytics Bootcamp | Unit 9 SQL Challenge | Hewlett Packard Analysis

For this challenge, I used PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy to analyze data on employee salaries, titles, demographics etc. Through this analysis, I concluded that most employees earned a salary greater than $40,000 and less than or equal to $60,000. I also noticed that the average salaries by title were fairly similar, with the lowest average being $48,506.80 for senior engineers, and the highest average being $58,550.17 for senior staff.

**Data Folder:**
- Contains all data used in each analysis.

**Images Folder:**
- Contains ERD, histogram, and bar graph images. 

**Queries Folder:**
- Contains queries for creating tables in PostgreSQL, executing the analysis in PostgreSQL, and creating the histogram and bar chart using Pandas.
