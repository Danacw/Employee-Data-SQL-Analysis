# SQL-Challenge
UC Davis Data Analytics Bootcamp | Unit 9 SQL Challenge | Hewlett Packard Analysis

For this challenge, I used PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy to build a database and analyze data on employee salaries, titles and demographics. I first created an ERD to map out the relationship between the provided CSV files and query tables in PostgreSQL. I then imported the Postgre database into Jupyter Noteboook to analyze salary ranges throughout the company. Through my analysis, I found that the majority of employees earned a salary greater than $40,000 and less than or equal to $60,000. 

**Data Folder:**
- Contains all data used in each analysis.

**Images Folder:**
- Contains ERD, histogram, and bar graph images. 

**Queries Folder:**
- Contains queries for creating tables in PostgreSQL, executing the analysis in PostgreSQL, and creating the histogram and bar chart using Pandas.
